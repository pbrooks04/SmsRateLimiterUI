# SMS Rate Limiter Front End

This React & TypeScript project is the front end to my C# ASP .NET Core service which can be found here: https://github.com/pbrooks04/SmsRateLimiter/tree/master/SmsRateLimiter

## Purpose
To provide an interface to compliment the SMS rate limiter service. This UI allows a mock message to be sent and displays the history of the records that have been sent. The history results can be sorted and filtered.

The form provides an example of simple validation as it ensures required fills have been filled and that phone numbers consist of 10 digits.
